- 👋 Hi, I’m Bethany Tormino  
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, crafting, learning, teaching, and creating.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript, C#, SQL, Python, and Java.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools for educators (especially Montessori educators), tools for mental health (especially for case managers and care coordinators), and anything else that may help me learn a new skill.
